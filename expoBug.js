This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your React Native application.  It's not a standard error message, and often points to an underlying issue within your app's code or dependencies. It's usually related to a mismatch between the version of React Native you're using in your app and what Expo Go supports, or problems with your project setup or dependencies. There is no specific error message, so debugging is done through testing and reviewing logs.
